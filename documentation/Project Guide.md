# Project Guide

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Pharmaceutical Data Pipeline Platform is a cloud-native system built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that automates the collection, processing, and analysis of pharmaceutical industry data. The system features a modular architecture with separate web scraping and document processing capabilities, providing a flexible framework for implementing custom business logic while maintaining robust infrastructure.

Key components include:
- Web Scraping Module for automated data collection
- Document Processing Pipeline for OCR and NLP analysis
- Multi-tiered storage using GCS and BigQuery
- REST API for secure data access
- Comprehensive monitoring and security controls

The platform is designed to serve data engineers, technical developers, and API consumers who need reliable access to structured pharmaceutical industry data.
